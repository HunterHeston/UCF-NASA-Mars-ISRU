                		---	a Java Example HLA Federate ---
        
This file contains information on an example SEE HLA Federate created by using the 
capabilities provided by the SEE HLA Starter Kit.
The SEE HLA Start Kit is released under the open source policy Lesser GNU Public License 
(LGPL) and aims at supporting the development of HLA Federates in the context of the SEE project.
It allows developers to focus on the specific aspects of their own Federates rather than 
dealing with the common HLA issues such as the management of the simulation time; 
the connection/disconnection on/from the HLA RTI; the publish, subscribe and updating of 
ObjectClass and InteractionClass elements. 
The SEE HLA Starter Kit is designed and developed by the SMASH-Lab (System Modeling And Simulation Hub - 
Laboratory) of the University of Calabria working in cooperation with NASA JSC 
(Johnson Space Center).

For more detail about the SEE HLA Starter Kit, please,

 NOTE: Knowledge of the HLA is assumed, but if you are just getting started out,
       there are some resources on the SEE project website (http://www.exploresim.com/) 
       that you may find helpful.

 1. Getting Started
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This example application provides the basic template code for a very simple
 SEE HLA Federate created by using the capabilities provided by the SEE HLA Starter Kit and 
 its software Framework (SKF). 
 It is not intended to be an impression display of what you can do with the SEE HLA Starter 
 Kit, but rather just a display of how to use it.
 
 The "LunarRover" example Federate consists of six main files:
   * src/core/LunarRoverFederate.java           	// The LunarRover Federate
   * src/core/LunarRoverFederateAmbassador.java 	// The LunarRover Federate Ambassador
   * src/model/LunarRover.java			        	// The LunarRover model
   * src/model/Position.java			        	// The 3-Vector position object
   * src/model/HLAPositionCoder.java				// The Position's coder
   * src/Main.java									// The main class
   

 The actual design of the 'LunarRover' Federate is very simple. It just publishes the 
 'LunarRover' entity and every simulation step updates its position. In addition to 
 publishing information, the 'LunarRover' Federate also subscribes the 'MoonCentricFixed' 
 ReferenceFrame, which is published and updated by the 'Environment' Federate.
 
 The 'LunarRoverFederateAmbassador' class is used by the SKF for interacting with both the 
 'LunarRover' Federate and the HLA/RTI infrastructure.
 
 The 'LunarRover' class defines the structure and attributes of the vehicle according to
 the SKF specification.
 
 The 'Position' class defines a 3-vector that specifies the position of the vehicle body 
 frame origin with respect to the parent reference frame.
 
 The 'HLAPositionCoder' class defines a specific coder, which is created according to the
 SKF specification, to encode and decode a Position object.

 2. Supported Platforms
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The SEE HLA Starte Kit is officially supported on:

  * Java JDK 7 (version 7+)
  * Pitch RTI (version 5.0.1.0); MÄK RTI (version 4.2h)
  * Ubuntu 12.04 LTS for 32 and 64-bit
  * Mac OS X 10.8+ for 64-bit
  * Windows 7/8 32/64-bit

 --- JAVA ---
 
 * JDK Requirements
 Please note that you need to have a JDK installed on your system and have
 the environment variable JAVA_HOME set to point to it in order to compile
 the 'LunarRover' Federate.

 * JDK Version
 The SEE HLA Starter Kit has been built by using Java 7 and requires a Java 7 JDK. 
 If you are using a Java 6 environment or earlier, the 'LunarRover' Federate may work,
 but that is not officially supported.
 
 --- HLA/RTI infrastructure ---
 
 * Please note that you need to have an HLA/RTI infrastructure installed on your system
   (e.g. PITCH RTI, MÄK, etc.).

 4. The "LunarRover" example step-by-step (with Resources)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This section describes how to implement a simple SEE Federate (in this case The 
 "LunarRover" federate) by using the SEE HLA Starter Kit and the Eclipse for Java developer
 IDE (website: http://eclipse.org/home/index.php). 
 
 1. Create a new Java Project. Click on File -> New -> Java Project.
 2. Fill in the "project name" field with the name of the project (in this case: LunarRover).
 3. Be sure that you use a JRE version 7.0 or higher. 
 4. Expanding the Java project and create four folders:
	4.1 a "lib" folder, which will contain the SKF jar and the HLA/RTI jars (in this 
		example: the PITCH RTI jars).
	4.2 a "log4j" folder, which will contain the xml file created according to the 
	    Apache Log4j2 specification.
	4.3 a "foms" folder that will contain the LunarRover.xml file.
	4.4 and, a "config" folder that will contain the json configuration file.
 5. Put in the: 
 	5.1 "config" folder a configuration json file that contains all the parameters 
    	    that will be used by the SEE HLA Starter Kit to set up and manage the "LunarRover" 
    	    Federate;
        5.2 "foms" folder the LunarRover.xml file;
        5.3 "log4j" folder a specific xml file created according to the Apache Log4j2 
            specification. This xml file enables the Logging service of the SEE HLA StarterKit;
        5.4 "lib" folder the SKF.jar file and the HLA/RTI jars (for PITCH/RTI: booster.jar, 
             prti.jar, prti1516e.jar, and, prticore.jar that are available in the PITCH installation
             directory). After that, add all jars to the project build path.
 6. Create the Java code.
 	6.1 Create a new package called "model", which will contain the java code related to 
 	    the structure of the "LunarRover" Federate (see: src/model/LunarRover.java;
   		src/model/Position.java; and, src/model/HLAPositionCoder.java).
   	6.2 Create a new package called "core", which will contains the Federate and Federate 
   	    Ambassador of the "LunarRover" Federate (see: src/core/LunarRoverFederate.java; and,
   		src/core/LunarRoverFederateAmbassador.java).
   	6.3 Create the LunarRover Main class (see: Main.java)
    
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 4. Running the "LunarRover" Federate
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 	
 	This section describes how to run the "LunarRover" Federate in the SEE 2015 Federation
 	Environment.
	
	1. Run PITCH/RTI;
	2. Run the 'Environment' Federate provided by the NASA team;
	3. Finally, run the "LunarRover" Federate. If you want enable the SKF logging services,
	   put in the classpath of the project the "log4j" folder (*). In this way you can trace 
	   the execution of the LunarRover Federate during its simulation in the SEE 2015 
	   Federation Environment.

        The actions performed by the 'LunarRover' Federate are the following:
        
   	a. Load the configuration parameters from a .json file
   	b. Connect to the SEE 2015 Federation
   	c. Join the SEE 2015 Federation
   	d. Publish the 'LunarRover' entity and Subscribe the 'MoonCentricFixed' ReferenceFrame
   	e. Execution-Loop, doing the following each step:
       		* The position of the 'LunarRover' is updated of 10 units along the x axis so as to
       	 	reflect its moving.
   	f. Wait for the user to press any key
   	l. Delete the object instance
   	m. Resign from the SEE 2015 Federation
	   
	NOTE:
	* To add the "log4j" folder in the project's classpath click on:
		 Run -> Run Configuration -> [classpath tab] -> click on user Entries -> Advanced
		 -> Select Add Folder -> select the location of your log4j folder, and then -> OK.
